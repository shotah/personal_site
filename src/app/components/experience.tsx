              As a Senior Software Developer at Meta, I played a key role in
              developing AI plugins for Sports and POI search. My work laid the
              groundwork for ongoing evaluation, ensuring the quality and
              effectiveness of these features. I also leveraged AI to generate
              synthetic data and perform first-pass quality evaluations,
              significantly enhancing the efficiency of our testing process.
              This included building end-to-end evaluation code, interactive
              dashboards, and comprehensive datasets for the POI Search plugin,
              enabling iterative improvements in search result quality.

            <p>
              At Leica Biosystems, I led the development of a multi-threaded Go
              CLI application for capturing microscope slide images. This
              project included both the CLI application and the server-side
              cloud component for AWS, GCP, and Azure, each with 80% test
              coverage. I also managed the Docker container definitions,
              ensuring seamless deployment across Lambda, Cloud Run, and other
              containerized environments. I contributed to defining coding
              standards and implementing automated deployments.

              Initially tasked with leading the development of a replacement

              cancellation, I pivoted to implement Axe Deque accessibility
              services in TypeScript, integrating them into Android emulated
              devices and developing the JavaScript frontend updates to display
              accessibility results.

            <p>
              During my time at Amazon Web Services, I made significant
              contributions to the codebase, improving its quality and
              maintainability. I refactored and removed thousands of lines of
              unused code, resulting in a more streamlined and efficient system.
              I also completely overhauled the lambda deployment process,
              transitioning to a fully automated and standardized CI/CD
              pipeline. I introduced Makefiles for consistent builds and
              zipping, AWS SAM for streamlined local build/test workflows, and
              pipenv/pre-commit for standardized linting and testing. Finally, I
              integrated these improvements into their existing Jenkins
              pipelines, ensuring all deployments to production occurred
              exclusively through CI/CD after code merge to the main branch.
              This eliminated inconsistencies and significantly improved
              deployment reliability.
